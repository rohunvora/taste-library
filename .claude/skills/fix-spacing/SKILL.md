# Fix Spacing Issues

Applies these laws from lawsofux.com:
- **Law of Proximity**: Objects near each other appear grouped
- **Law of Common Region**: Elements sharing a boundary appear related
- **Law of Uniform Connectedness**: Visually connected elements seem more related

## When This Activates

- "Cards feel like islands"
- "Everything is the same distance apart"
- "Elements feel disconnected"
- "Groupings are unclear"
- "No visual rhythm"

## The Laws

### Law of Proximity

> Objects that are near each other tend to be grouped together.

**Application:**
```
Space WITHIN groups < Space BETWEEN groups

Card padding < Gap between cards < Section gap
```

**Violation test:**
```
Proximity Ratio = internal spacing / external spacing
PASS: ratio < 1.0
FAIL: ratio ≥ 1.0
```

### Law of Common Region

> Elements tend to be perceived as groups if they share a clearly defined boundary.

**Application:**
- Add backgrounds, borders, or containers to create regions
- Don't rely on proximity alone for complex groupings
- Nested regions show hierarchy

### Law of Uniform Connectedness

> Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.

**Application:**
- Lines, arrows, or shared colors connect related items
- Timelines, flowcharts, breadcrumbs use this
- Stronger than proximity for showing relationships

## Diagnosis

For each group of elements, check:

```
1. PROXIMITY: Is internal < external spacing?
2. REGION: Do related items share a boundary?
3. CONNECTION: Are sequential items visually linked?
```

## Output Format

```
SPACING DIAGNOSIS

Law of Proximity:
WHERE: [component]
Ratio: [internal]px / [external]px = [X]
Violation: [Yes/No]
FIX: [change]

Law of Common Region:
WHERE: [component]
Issue: [missing boundary / competing regions]
FIX: [add container / adjust]

Law of Uniform Connectedness:
WHERE: [component]
Issue: [disconnected sequence]
FIX: [add connector]
```

## Quick Reference

| Spacing | Tailwind | Use for |
|---------|----------|---------|
| 4px | gap-1, p-1 | Tight inline elements |
| 8px | gap-2, p-2 | Related items in a group |
| 16px | gap-4, p-4 | Items within a card |
| 24px | gap-6, p-6 | Cards in a grid |
| 32px | gap-8 | Between sections |
| 48-64px | py-12/16 | Major section breaks |

**Rule:** Each level should be ~1.5-2x the previous.
