# Fix Visual Hierarchy

Applies these laws from lawsofux.com:
- **Von Restorff Effect**: Distinctive items among similar ones are remembered
- **Serial Position Effect**: First and last items are most memorable
- **Law of Prägnanz**: People interpret complex images in the simplest way

## When This Activates

- "Everything looks the same"
- "CTA doesn't stand out"
- "Users miss important info"
- "Page feels flat"
- "Too much competing for attention"

## The Laws

### Von Restorff Effect (Isolation Effect)

> When multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.

**Application:**
```
Make ONE thing visually distinct:
- Different color (only CTA is blue)
- Different size (hero text 2x larger)
- Different weight (only headline is bold)
- Different treatment (only CTA has shadow)
```

**Violation:** Multiple elements using the "special" treatment.

### Serial Position Effect

> Users best remember the first and last items in a series.

**Application:**
```
FIRST position: Most important action/info
LAST position: Secondary important action
MIDDLE: Supporting content (will be skimmed)
```

**For navigation:** Home (first), CTA (last)
**For forms:** Key field (first), Submit (last)
**For lists:** Critical items at ends

### Law of Prägnanz (Simplicity)

> People perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible.

**Application:**
```
Reduce to minimum elements needed:
- Remove decorative complexity
- Use simple shapes over complex ones
- Clear figure/ground relationship
- Obvious visual hierarchy
```

**Test:** Can a user describe the page in one sentence?

## Diagnosis

```
1. VON RESTORFF: Is exactly ONE element isolated/distinct?
2. SERIAL POSITION: Are key items at start/end?
3. PRÄGNANZ: Is hierarchy immediately obvious?
```

## Output Format

```
HIERARCHY DIAGNOSIS

Von Restorff Effect:
Primary element: [what should stand out]
Currently isolated: [what actually stands out]
Competing elements: [list of things fighting for attention]
FIX: [make X distinct, reduce prominence of Y]

Serial Position Effect:
First position: [what's there] → [what should be]
Last position: [what's there] → [what should be]
FIX: [reorder]

Law of Prägnanz:
Complexity score: [high/medium/low]
Can describe in one sentence: [Yes/No]
FIX: [simplify by...]
```

## Quick Fixes

| Problem | Law | Fix |
|---------|-----|-----|
| CTA invisible | Von Restorff | Make it the ONLY colored/bold element |
| Users skip content | Serial Position | Move to first or last position |
| Page overwhelming | Prägnanz | Remove 30% of elements |
| Everything bold | Von Restorff | Unbold everything except ONE |
| Nav items equal | Serial Position | Emphasize first and last |
